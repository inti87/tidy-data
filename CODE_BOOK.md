# Study Design

Data for this project was as part of Coursera - **Getting and Cleaaning Data Course Assignment**.

Original dataset can be found here: [link to Raw Data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
The dataset is part of [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

The whole idea of the project is to apply data clening and data wrangling techniques in order to get tidy data. In order to do so, our procedure executes given major steps:

* download raw data
* merge training and test data sets into one data set
* extract only specific variables from the data set
* apply cleaning techniques to clean names of the variables
* finally obtain tidy data set
* create additional data set by applying aggreation on tidy data
